# About Me

I am a 17 y/o guy living in Germany. I am interested in tech, Linux, FOSS and selfhosting.

One of my hobbies is tinkering around with my linux box and trying to get away from big tech firms like Google, Microsoft and so on.

For this I selfhost some services like Jellyfin, my mediaserver, a Matrix server so that I can chat with my family, my own blog and website, TinyTiny RSS and Wallabag.

Furthermore I like to do parkour, play volleyball and am getting back into reading.
