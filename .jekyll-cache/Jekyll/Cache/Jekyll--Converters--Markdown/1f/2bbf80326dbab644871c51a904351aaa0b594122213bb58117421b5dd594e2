<p>I am a 17 y/o guy living in Germany. I am interested in tech, Linux, FOSS and selfhosting.</p>

<p>One of my hobbies is tinkering around with my linux box and trying to get away from big tech firms like Google, Microsoft and so on.</p>

<p>For this I selfhost some services like Jellyfin, my mediaserver, a Matrix server so that I can chat with my family, my own blog and website, TinyTiny RSS and Wallabag.</p>

<p>Furthermore I like to do parkour, play volleyball and am getting back into reading.</p>
