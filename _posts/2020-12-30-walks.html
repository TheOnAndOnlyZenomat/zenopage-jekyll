I want to tell you about the walk I took today.
</p>

<p>
The majority of yesterday afternoon and night and today I spend on getting this site to do and look exactly like I want it to behave and look. And while I enjoy doing stuff like this it can be quite exhausting, if you do it over such an extended period of time without any mayor breaks.
</p>

<p>
So I decided to go for a walk.
</p>

<p>
I started to go on walks just a few weeks back, maybe a month. One day I brought my girlfriend home and instead of going straight home I took a turn and just walked around my neighborhood for maybe and hour, two. And I really enjoyed it. And I was kinda surprised, that I enjoyed it that much. Mind me, I am a 17 year old nerd. It is not exactly common for my type to casually go for walks.
</p>

<p>
And since then I would sometimes just grab my headphones, put on a podcast and start strolling around, taking a turn here and there and exploring this street which I barely ever noticed.
</p>

<p>
After finished this site today I felt exhausted, weary. I love going on walks, when it is already dark, in the evening. It was something around 19'o clock (7 p.m. for Americans), so a perfect time, in my view. I grabbed my headphones and started walking.
I walked a few streets, when I paused my podcast and just walked. At first it was a little strange, but I got accustomed to it. So I wandered like this a maybe 15 minutes, until I put my headphones back on.
Now, this might not seem like a big deal to some of you, but for me, it kinda was. Usually I always have something on my ears, I rarely do something without there being anything else, so this is why this was something new to me.
</p>

<p>
Later I got to a crossroad. I planed on going a route I already knew, but then and there I decided to take the other turn.
</p>

<p>
I again walked quite some thing, next to me an enormous warehouse, with neon-lights and then this street, but with barely any cars. Just this huge street which the orange light of the lanterns at the roadside.
I love this aesthetics, this cyberpunk-ish looking world.
And then I got to this little road, only for pedestrians, or bikes, which is between this huge meadow and this tiny little forest with a tiny river and a see. No lanterns. And I took the turn.
After a few minutes I look over at the meadow and decided, I don't know why, it is fucking winter, 4 degree Celsius at best, that I should lay down.
</p>

<p>
So I lay down, on the grass and just look into the sky. And I notice. The sky was beautiful. I could see the stars and the almost full moon, being incredibly bright and those thin clouds wandering over me, illuminated by the moon. It was amazing. I once again pause my podcast and just lie there, gazing into the night.
</p>

<p>
And in this moment there were only <b><b>this moment</b></b> and I, next to my thoughts. Nothing else. No school, no corona, no tech, <i>nothing</i>. The only thing I could hear was the monotonous white noise of a nearby highway, otherwise just utter silence.
</p>

<p>
I don't know how long I have been there, maybe 15-20 minutes, but it was a beautiful moment. A moment, which I maybe should be experiencing more.
</p>

<p>
So now I sit here, beautifully relaxed, writing this post.
</p>

<p>
So, people, go for walks.
